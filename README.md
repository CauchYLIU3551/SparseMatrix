# SparseMatrix
This is a basic implement of CRS in C++

This is a simple practice in computing sparse matrix. It is unfinished yet.

In this sparsematrix.h, I use the CRS method to save the matrix and it will provide a series of operations of sparse matrix, such as multiply and add.

In the future, I hope I can achieve the Jacobi iterations method to solve large scale sparse matrix to solve some 'Ax=b' problem with this .h file!
