# SparseMatrix
This is a basic implement of CRS in C++

This is a simple practice in computing sparse matrix. It is unfinished yet.

In this sparsematrix.h, I use the CRS method to save the matrix and it will provide a series of operations of sparse matrix.
I finish the class function such as :
1.multiply 2. add 3. divide A into L, U, D such that A=L+U+D(it will be helpful in Jacobi iteration) 4. show the values in sparsematrix 5. inverse (unfinised!) 

In the future, I hope I can achieve the Jacobi iterations method to solve large scale sparse matrix to solve some 'Ax=b' problem with this .h file!
